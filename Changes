        - Removed requirement for Perl 5.8.8 from Makefile.PL.  That
	  was inserted by h2ph and I hadn't noticed it.

       - Restructured the class.  The initial implementation used a
         single package for variant and non-variant records.  All
         attempts to format or unformat buffers resulted in checking
         for variants.  Non-variant records can now skip this step and
         should be faster.

       - B<Data::FixedFormat> was rewritten to handle a single
         variant.  The C<new> method now returns a
         B<Data::FixedFormat::Variants> if a variant record layout is
         requested.  This class maintains a list of
         B<Data::FixedFormat> objects to perform conversions.

       - Added the C<blank> method.

       - Updated the documentation and corrected some errors in the
         examples.
